# TikTok-source-code

Full source code to the android tiktok app.

# background

This project is a bit different from my other projects. TikTok is a data collection engine disguised as a social media platform. It's legitimate spyware, so I thought I would reverse engineer the Android application

Included are the classes.jar and classes.dex

You can find all of the source in the classes/ folder.

The main functionality of the app is in df_miniapp. The rest is just included for the sake of completeness. Most of it is useless. 

China, I'll see you when you send the hitmen to my house.

Here is the full reverse engineered source code. Enjoy


[NOTE] this is where I got the APK. https://apkpure.com/tiktok/com.ss.android.ugc.trill
